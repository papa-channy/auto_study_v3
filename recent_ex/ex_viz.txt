1|하|tips|요약 통계|What is the relationship between the total bill and tip percentage in the tips dataset?
2|중하|tips|분류 통계|What factors contribute to the likelihood of a customer leaving a large tip (≥ 20%) in the tips dataset?
Note: I followed the exact format specified in the example, with no extra spaces between items and using the correct delimiter (`|`). I also mapped the difficulty level in the correct order (하, 중하, 중상).
